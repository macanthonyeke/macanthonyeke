## 📂 Projects

### 🔹 Staking Vault (Lock-Based Rewards)
**Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin**  
🔗 https://github.com/macanthonyeke/Solidity-Programs/blob/main/staking-vault-redo

A lock-based staking contract that rewards users with fixed bonuses based on predefined lock periods.

- Implemented a staking vault supporting multiple independent stake positions per user
- Designed lock-period–based reward incentives with fixed reward percentages
- Enforced time-locked withdrawals using on-chain timestamp checks
- Secured ERC20 transfers using OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20
- Added reentrancy protection and emergency pause functionality using OpenZeppelin modules
- Explored tradeoffs between fixed reward staking and time-based emission models
